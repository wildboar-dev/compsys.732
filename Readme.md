# Demo Code #

This is demo code put together to show various tracking systems. 

**NOTE:** Unfortunately this code is currently very messy! I hope to clean it up soon. Any questions please contract [Trevor](t.gee@auckland.ac.nz).

The code has a dependency on this [repo](https://gitlab.com/project437/nvlib.git). I am also currently working towards removing this.

Any feedback or cleanup of the code welcome!

## Current Projects ##

* **Aligner** - Shows a basic implementation of ICP combined with Direct Odometry (using OpenCV's *RgbdICPOdometry*).
* **Aruco** - Is a basic Aruco detector.
* **FTracker** - Is a basic feature point based tracker.
